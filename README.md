I'm a Software Engineer, focused on C# and Unnity technologies, seeking to continue evolving as a developer to better develop solutions and always studying and updating to ensure deeper  knowledge.

I am currently migrating to the software development area, where I discovered what I love to do, but already worked as a Lawyer for 6 years guaranteeing me deep knowledge soft skills such as communication, teamwork, intrapreneurship, and autonomy to learn by myself.

I'm currently based in Brazil looking for new opportunities, and interested in continuing to evolve and learn more so that this can be reflected in improving the quality of my work
